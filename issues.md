# Issues #
Issues are handled within each project as well as in a [common issues project](https://github.com/brailleapps/issues/issues). 


The common issues project exists to:
- manage issues that apply to several projects or depend on serveral other issues in multiple projects
- act as an entry point for end users to register issues

The project specific issue trackers should be used for issues only related to that specific project.
